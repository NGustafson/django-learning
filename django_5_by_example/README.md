## Examples from Django 5 By Example - Fifth Edition
This directory contains the code I wrote while working through **Django 5 By Example**.  It is nearly identical to the examples in the book.

Each chapter in the book corresponds to a branch in this repo.

I used a single `requirements.txt` for the first 3 example projects (mysite, bookmarks, and myshop).  The educa project has its own.
